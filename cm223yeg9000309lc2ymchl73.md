Welcome back to our Django tutorial series! In **Day 4**, we'll delve into creating a custom user model in Django and how to register it. We'll also walk through creating a superuser to test our new model. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a custom user model that fits your project's specific needs.

## Why Create a Custom User Model?

While Django provides a default `User` model, it might not cover all the fields your project requires. If you need to store additional user information—such as a profile picture, address, or job title—it's better to create a custom user model. You can achieve this by creating an `accounts` app and defining a `CustomUser` model with the extra fields you need.

## Registering the Accounts App

In the previous article, we created an app called `accounts`. Before we start modifying models, we need to register this app in our project's [`settings.py`](http://settings.py) file.

Open `projectpulse/`[`settings.py`](http://settings.py) and add `"accounts"` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

```python
# projectpulse/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "accounts",
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    # ... other installed apps
]
```

This tells Django to include the `accounts` app when running migrations and other management commands.

## Creating the Custom User Model

Now, let's create a custom user model step by step. We'll break it down into three main parts:

1. **Defining User Roles using Enums**
    
2. **Creating a Custom User Manager**
    
3. **Defining the Custom User Model**
    

All of these will be added to `accounts/`[`models.py`](http://models.py).

### **Note**: Make sure to import necessary modules as we proceed.

### 1\. Defining User Roles with Enums

First, we'll define user roles using Python's `enum` module. This allows us to have a set of predefined choices for user roles.

```python
# accounts/models.py

from enum import Enum

class UserRoles(Enum):
    """Defines the user roles within the application."""
    ADMIN = "Admin"
    PROJECT_MANAGER = "Project Manager"
    TEAM_MEMBER = "Team Member"
```

### 2\. Creating a Custom User Manager

Next, we'll create a custom user manager by extending `BaseUserManager`. This manager will handle the creation of regular users and superusers.

```python
# accounts/models.py

from django.contrib.auth.base_user import BaseUserManager

class CustomUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    """Custom user manager for the CustomUser model."""

    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        """Creates and returns a regular user."""
        if not email:
            raise ValueError("The Email field must be set.")
        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        """Creates and returns a superuser."""
        extra_fields.setdefault("is_staff", True)
        extra_fields.setdefault("is_superuser", True)
        extra_fields.setdefault("role", UserRoles.ADMIN.value)

        if extra_fields.get("is_staff") is not True:
            raise ValueError("Superuser must have is_staff=True.")
        if extra_fields.get("is_superuser") is not True:
            raise ValueError("Superuser must have is_superuser=True.")
        if extra_fields.get("role") != UserRoles.ADMIN.value:
            raise ValueError("Superuser must have role=Admin.")

        return self.create_user(email, password, **extra_fields)
```

**Explanation**:

* **create\_user**: Handles the creation of regular users. It normalizes the email, sets the password, and saves the user.
    
* **create\_superuser**: Handles the creation of superusers. It ensures that certain fields are set appropriately.
    

### 3\. Defining the Custom User Model

Now, we'll define the `CustomUser` model by extending `AbstractUser`. We'll replace the username field with an email field and add additional fields as needed.

```python
# accounts/models.py

from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    """
    Custom user model that uses email instead of username.
    Additional fields can be added as required.
    """
    username = None
    email = models.EmailField(_("email address"), unique=True)
    profile_picture = models.ImageField(upload_to="profile_pictures/", blank=True, null=True)
    role = models.CharField(
        max_length=20,
        choices=[(role.value, role.value) for role in UserRoles],
        default=UserRoles.TEAM_MEMBER.value
    )

    USERNAME_FIELD = "email"
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = ["first_name", "last_name"]

    objects = CustomUserManager()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.id} - {self.get_full_name()}"
```

**Explanation**:

* **username = None**: We remove the username field since we'll use email for authentication.
    
* **email**: Set as the unique identifier for authentication.
    
* **profile\_picture**: An optional field to store the user's profile picture.
    
* **role**: A field to store the user's role, with choices defined by `UserRoles`.
    
* **USERNAME\_FIELD**: Specifies the field used for authentication (email in this case).
    
* **REQUIRED\_FIELDS**: Additional fields required when creating a superuser.
    
* **objects**: Specifies the custom manager we created earlier.
    

### Updating `AUTH_USER_MODEL` in Settings

To tell Django to use our custom user model, add the following line to your [`settings.py`](http://settings.py):

```python
# projectpulse/settings.py

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser'
```

## Applying Migrations

Now that we've defined our custom user model, we need to create and apply migrations to update the database.

### 1\. Create Migrations

Run the following command to create migration files:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
Migrations for 'accounts':
  accounts/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model CustomUser
```

### 2\. Apply Migrations

Apply the migrations to update the database schema:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This will create the necessary tables in your database for the `accounts` app.

## Creating a Superuser

To test our custom user model, let's create a superuser account.

Run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You'll be prompted to enter the following information:

* **Email address**: Provide a valid email.
    
* **First name** and **Last name**: Since we added these to `REQUIRED_FIELDS`.
    
* **Password**: Enter a secure password.
    

```bash
Email address: admin@example.com
First name: Admin
Last name: User
Password: ********
Password (again): ********
Superuser created successfully.
```

## What's Next?

In this tutorial, we've:

* Registered the `accounts` app in our project settings.
    
* Created a custom user model with additional fields.
    
* Applied migrations to update the database.
    
* Created a superuser to test the new user model.
    

In the **next article**, we'll focus on creating custom forms for our `CustomUser` and integrating them into the Django admin panel for easier management.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully implemented a custom user model in Django, which is a significant step in customizing your web application to meet specific requirements. Custom user models offer flexibility and scalability, allowing you to add as many custom fields as your project needs
